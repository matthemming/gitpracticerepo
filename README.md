[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"


what the difference is between: commit, clone, push and pull... and summarize this information in a table with 3 columns: action | frequency of use | command line git bash command
make your MD look as appealing as possible...
Could you include the logo for git as an image also.

|:-----------:|:--------------:|:----:|
| commit        | right-aligned     | git commit -m "Commit message" |
| clone         | centered          | git clone /path/to/repository |
| push          | centered          | git push origin master |
