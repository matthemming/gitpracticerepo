what the difference is between: commit, clone, push and pull... and summarize this information in a table with 3 columns: action | frequency of use | command line git bash command
make your MD look as appealing as possible...
Could you include the logo for git as an image also.

- Commit commits changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository)
- Clone creates a working copy of a repository
- Push sends changes to the master branch of your remote repository
- Pull fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory

| Action  | Frequency of Use | Command Line Git Bash Command |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|:----:|
| commit        | right-aligned     | git commit -m "Commit message" |
| clone         | centered          | git clone /path/to/repository |
| push          | centered          | git push origin master |
| pull          | centered          | git pull |
